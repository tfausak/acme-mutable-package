synopsis: A mutable package.
description:
  > -- | This is a joke package. It is meant to show Haskell packages on
  > -- Hackage can be mutated by revising them. This package uses a custom
  > -- Cabal setup. It reads the package description, which is what you are
  > -- reading now, and creates a file at build time from its contents. Since
  > -- revisions are allowed to change descriptions, the package itself is
  > -- mutable. I personally disagree with Hackage revisions, so I authored
  > -- this package to show one way they can be abused.
